2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock c is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/top_mine_0/inst/clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock p is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/top_mine_0/inst/clk_TMDS. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock c is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock c is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#3 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock p is defined downstream of clock clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#4 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock p is defined downstream of clock clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks c and p are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks c] -to [get_clocks p]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks c and p are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks c] -to [get_clocks p]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw relative to clock(s) c 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hdmi_tx_n[0] relative to clock(s) p 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hdmi_tx_n[1] relative to clock(s) p 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hdmi_tx_n[2] relative to clock(s) p 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hdmi_tx_p[0] relative to clock(s) p 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hdmi_tx_p[1] relative to clock(s) p 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hdmi_tx_p[2] relative to clock(s) p 
Related violations: <none>
